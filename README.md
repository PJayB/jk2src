Jedi Knight II Source Code compiled in Visual Studio 2012 &amp; Windows 8 SDK. If you nobble the .sln and .vcxproj files, you could easily load this in VS2010 with the DirectX SDK.

This is a work in progress, but it does compile in Debug. Whether it runs is 
"future work" :)

"Why not Jedi Academy?" I hear you cry. That's still a work-in-progress. Raven have released the Xbox source to the game, which will involve a great deal of untangling. Watch this space.
