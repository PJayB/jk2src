Jedi Knight II Source Code compiled in Visual Studio 2012 &amp; Windows 8 SDK. If you nobble the .sln and .vcxproj files, you could easily load this in VS2010 with the DirectX SDK.

This code is provided with the "It Works On My Machine" guarantee. For a good debugging experience, I recommend hitting Alt+Enter as soon as the game hits the main menu.

"Why not Jedi Academy?" I hear you cry. That's still a work-in-progress. Raven have released the Xbox-specific source to the game which will involve a great deal of untangling. Watch this space.
